Description: A unique set of 89 pancreatic cancer samples profiled using both sequencing and microarray 
  platform was used for training the PCOSP (Pancreatic cancer overall survival predictor) to predict 
  patients with early death (within >1 yr) after surgery. Further, to validate the model we used genomic 
  profiles of 823 samples curated from public domain. The simplistic k-top scoring pair approach was used 
  to build the model, where we looked at relative expression of gene pairs within the patient.
